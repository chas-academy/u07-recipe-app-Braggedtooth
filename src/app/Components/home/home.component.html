                    A fun project that challenged in me in many ways, the page you are seeing right now is the second iteration. I learned a harsh lesson by accidentally deleteing the first iteration of this project and others without a backup and neglecting to push my commits.
                    Lesson Learned! Anyways i had lots of fun navigateing through angular even though i went into it with a pretty narrow mindset, this project opened me up to understanding the why behind angular and respect it in many ways. The backend
                    part was less of a challenge but it could have been done in a better way.
